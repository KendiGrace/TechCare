TechCare application aims to disrupt this problem by digitally empowering thousands of community health workers (CHWs) with better ways of collecting community health-related data as well as providing accurate care and prompt follow-ups by using a web application that consists of the households, assessment questions, and respective information of the households in a given area. It also has a Calendar whereby they can schedule their tasks and also be notified on tasks scheduled by respective organizations they work for. TechCare ensures consistent and accurate data records for the organizations which will, in turn, improve performance and workflows for pregnancy care, childhood diseases, nutrition, family planning, and immunization tracking in the communities.","title":"Home"},{"location":"documentation/","text":"Here is the link to the TechCare Community Health Worker User Manual. https://bit.ly/3mXiBi1","title":"Documentation"}]}
